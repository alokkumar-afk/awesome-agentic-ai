## What Is Agentic AI?

**Agentic AI** refers to AI systems that can pursue goals through multiple steps instead of only generating a single response. An agent typically combines a model with instructions, tools, external knowledge, state or memory, and a control loop that determines what to do next.

A useful mental model is:

**Model + Instructions + Context + Tools + State + Control Loop + Evaluation + Guardrails**

Not every AI application needs an autonomous agent. Deterministic workflows are often easier to test and safer to operate. Agentic approaches are most useful when a task involves ambiguity, changing information, tool use, iterative reasoning, dynamic planning, or decisions that cannot be fully encoded in advance.

Common Agentic AI capabilities include:

- Tool and function calling.
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
- Short-term and long-term memory.
- Planning and task decomposition.
- Reflection and iterative improvement.
- Routing and delegation.
- Multi-agent collaboration.
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations.
- Agent-to-agent interoperability.
- Human approval and escalation.
- Evaluation, tracing, and observability.
- Sandboxed code or computer use.

## Start Here

If you are new to Agentic AI, use this sequence:

1. **LLM fundamentals** - Understand prompts, context windows, structured outputs, model limitations, and API usage.
2. **Tool calling** - Learn how models select and invoke functions, APIs, search, databases, and external systems.
3. **Single-agent loops** - Build an agent that can decide, act, observe results, and continue until a task is complete.
4. **RAG and retrieval** - Give agents access to relevant external knowledge instead of relying only on model memory.
5. **State and memory** - Preserve useful information across steps, conversations, or sessions.
6. **Agentic patterns** - Learn routing, sequential workflows, parallelization, planner-executor, reflection, and evaluator-optimizer patterns.
7. **Multi-agent systems** - Introduce specialist agents only when decomposition or separation of responsibilities is useful.
8. **MCP and interoperability** - Connect agents to tools and external systems through standardized protocols.
9. **Evaluation** - Measure outcomes, tool use, trajectories, groundedness, reliability, latency, and cost.
10. **Guardrails and human approval** - Add permissions, validation, escalation, and review before granting consequential autonomy.
11. **Observability** - Trace model calls, tool calls, state changes, handoffs, errors, token usage, and latency.
12. **Production engineering** - Design for retries, idempotency, timeouts, fallbacks, security, monitoring, and controlled failure.

# Core Agentic AI Concepts and Patterns

## Augmented LLM

An LLM becomes more useful for real-world tasks when it is connected to capabilities such as retrieval, tools, memory, code execution, and external systems.

## Routing

A routing step classifies a request and directs it to the most appropriate model, tool, workflow, or specialist agent.

## Sequential Workflows

A task is broken into ordered stages where the output of one stage becomes the input to the next.

## Parallelization

Independent subtasks are executed concurrently and their results are combined. This is useful for research, verification, comparison, and multi-perspective analysis.

## Planner-Executor

A planner decomposes an objective into steps while one or more executors carry out those steps. The plan can be revised as new information becomes available.

## ReAct

Reasoning and acting are interleaved so an agent can select an action, observe the result, and use that observation to determine the next step.

## Reflection

The system critiques or reviews an intermediate result and uses that feedback to improve a later attempt.

## Evaluator-Optimizer

One component generates a result while another evaluates it against explicit criteria. The cycle continues until an acceptable result is produced or a stopping condition is reached.

## Supervisor and Specialist Agents

A coordinating agent delegates work to specialized agents and combines their results while retaining control of the overall task.

## Agents as Tools

A coordinating agent can call specialist agents through tool-like interfaces. This often preserves clearer control than unrestricted peer-to-peer agent conversation.

## Handoffs

Responsibility moves from one agent to another when the second agent is better suited to continue the task.

## Human in the Loop

A human reviews, approves, modifies, or rejects actions at important control points, especially before irreversible, sensitive, expensive, or high-impact operations.

When designing tools, consider:

- Clear tool names and descriptions.
- Strong input validation.
- Structured outputs where practical.
- Authentication and authorization outside the model.
- Least-privilege access.
- Timeouts and bounded retries.
- Idempotency for actions that may be retried.
- Explicit and useful error responses.
- Rate limits, quotas, and spend controls.
- Human approval for consequential actions.
- Audit logs for tool execution.
- Protection against untrusted tool output and prompt injection.

# Agent Evaluation and Testing

Agent evaluation should go beyond checking the final response. Mature evaluation also examines **what the agent did**, **which tools it used**, **whether the environment actually changed as intended**, and **whether the behavior remains reliable across updates**.

Useful dimensions include:

- Task completion.
- Final outcome correctness.
- Tool selection.
- Tool argument quality.
- Tool response handling.
- Trajectory quality.
- Number of steps.
- Groundedness.
- Hallucination.
- Safety and policy compliance.
- Recovery from tool failures.
- Human intervention rate.
- Latency.
- Token usage.
- Cost.

- [OpenAI Agents SDK Examples](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/examples/)
- [Microsoft AI Agents for Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/ai-agents-for-beginners)

A useful starting evaluation suite should include:

1. Representative normal tasks.
2. Known historical failure cases.
3. Tool-error scenarios.
4. Ambiguous instructions.
5. Adversarial or prompt-injection attempts.
6. Tasks requiring safe refusal or escalation.
7. Long-running tasks that stress memory and state.
8. Regression tests for every serious production incident.

# Observability and Tracing

An agent trace should make it possible to answer:

- Which model was called?
- Which instructions and context were supplied?
- Which tools were available?
- Which tool was selected?
- What arguments were generated?
- What did the tool return?
- Which agent or workflow step ran next?
- Which handoffs occurred?
- How long did each step take?
- How many tokens were used?
- What did the run cost?
- Where did the run fail?
- What changed between successful and failed runs?

# Guardrails, Security, and Human Oversight

Agentic applications expand the attack surface because models can interact with untrusted content and may be able to take actions through tools.

Important controls include:

- Input validation.
- Output validation.
- Prompt-injection defenses.
- Data access controls.
- Tool allowlists.
- Least-privilege permissions.
- Scoped credentials.
- Secrets isolation.
- Sandboxed execution.
- Network restrictions.
- Human approval gates.
- Spend and rate limits.
- Action previews.
- Audit trails.
- PII detection and redaction.
- Safe retry behavior.
- Kill switches and cancellation.
- Clear boundaries for irreversible operations.

## Human Approval

Human approval is especially important before:

- Sending messages or emails.
- Publishing content.
- Deleting or overwriting data.
- Spending money.
- Executing financial transactions.
- Changing permissions.
- Deploying code.
- Running destructive database operations.
- Accessing highly sensitive information.
- Taking actions that cannot be reliably reversed.

# Sandboxes and Computer Use

Agents that execute code, manipulate files, use shells, or control browsers should run inside constrained environments whenever practical.

- [browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) - Open-source tooling for browser-based agent workflows.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) - Container platform commonly used to isolate agent execution environments.
- [E2B](https://github.com/e2b-dev/E2B) - Isolated cloud sandboxes designed for AI-generated code and agent workloads.
- [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) - Browser automation framework useful for controlled web interaction and testing.
- [Playwright MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) - MCP integration that exposes browser automation capabilities to agents.

Recommended controls include:

- Ephemeral environments.
- Restricted filesystem access.
- Network allowlists.
- CPU, memory, and execution limits.
- Secret isolation.
- Non-root execution.
- Timeouts.
- Process cleanup.
- Logging.
- Human approval before sensitive external actions.
